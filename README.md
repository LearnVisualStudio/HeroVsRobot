HeroVsRobot is a casual game that utilizes various aspects of Azure. 
Intended for "Advanced Beginners" to learn from.

Docs forthcoming.

Start in the \Automation folder.  Read the: START-HERE.txt to help
get setup.  I'm not going to lie to you ... it's a bit rough to get
it up and running on your machine locally.

You WILL need an Azure account to get this to work.
